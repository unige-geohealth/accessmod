[![AccessMod Build Pipeline](https://github.com/unige-geohealth/accessmod/actions/workflows/accessmod_pipeline.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/unige-geohealth/accessmod/actions/workflows/accessmod_pipeline.yml)
## Summary

This is the main repository of `AccessMod 5`.

`AccessMod 5` is a tool to analyze geographical accessibility to or from given locations, using anisotropic movements and multimodal transport processes (e.g. walk, bicycles, motorized vehicles). This package may help to analyze catchments of peoples who can reach a central point in a given time and transport model or determine where new public services should be scaled up in priority.

This product is developed by the [GeoHealth group](https://unige.ch/geohealth) at the University of Geneva, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and [MORU/Health GeoLab Group](https://www.tropmedres.ac/units/moru-bangkok/epidemiology/our-team-1/health-geolab) (Manila, Philippines).

## Development

```sh
# Launch AccessMod stack 
# with app files bind mounted -> /app in docker-compose.yml 
$ docker compose up

# Check if the app server is working:  http://localhost:3180


# --------- app dev session 
$ npm run dev 
# OR
$ docker compose exec am5_dev R
> source('run.r')


# ---------- Replay analysis (dev)

# Launch a development session for the app
$ docker compose exec am5_dev R
> source('global.R')
> amAnalysisReplayExec("<path to config>.json")
# exemple in a dev session
> amAnalysisReplayExec("/data/dbgrass/demo/demo/accessmodConfigs/lAnalysisParameters__425.json")



# ---------- BUILD IMAGES
# Build base images
cd docker
./build.sh

# ---------- Github actions testing (not fully implemented)
act --secret-file .secrets --remote-name github --container-architecture linux/amd64


# ---------- TESTS 
# Default script 
$ npm run test
# - or - direct command with docker compose 
$ docker compose exec am5_dev Rscript tests/start.R 
# - or - from an interactive session 
$ docker compose exec am5_dev R
> source('tests/start.R') 

```

### Versionning 

When something is ready to be tested or published, update the version with this utility

```sh 
# create a new version
# from staging (image only) / main branch (full)
$ npm run version 
```


## Branches
- `main`: Contains the production-ready code..
- `staging`: Used for integrating new features and minor versions.

### Expected Workflow

1. **Integrate a feature in a dedicated branch.**
2. **Test the feature.**
3. **Merge into the `staging` branch.**

## Electron

```sh
cd electron
yarn start 
# yarn start:debug for an interactive session, with external debugger.
```
